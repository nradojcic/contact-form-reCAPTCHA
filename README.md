### Sending email using PHP. Single page Contact Form with reCAPTCHA spam protection.

**Problem:** How can I make it easier for visitors to my website to send me an email message directly from the webpage, without the need to switch to separate email app? Or to manually copy and enter my email address somewhere else? 

**Action:** Created a Contact Form page using HTML, CSS and PHP. Implemented form data collection and emailing functionality in PHP. Additionally, using PHP file format protects security of Google secret keys and email addresses in the source code deployed on the server. The form is designed on a separate webpage so it can fit both mobile phones and wider screens. 

**Result:** A responsive contact form that works equally well on desktop and smallest mobile devices. Allows sending short email message to my email address directly from the web page. No need to copy/paste email address or use email apps. Provides confirmation of email success or error. Additionally protected from spam and robots by Google reCAPTCHA.
